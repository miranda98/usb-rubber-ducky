## USB Rubber Ducky

This was a personal project for my Security Engineering and Cybersecurity Course at UNSW. In this repository you'll find 6 very basic 'attacks' that I came up with using a Rubber Ducky with both the DuckyScript form and the Arduino code that I used to execute the code. I used Duckuino to convert the Duckyscript to Arduino code, but made a few tweaks (especially since the Duckuino conversion for ENTER didn't work for me).

There are also links to my demonstrations of each attack in each Duckscript file.
